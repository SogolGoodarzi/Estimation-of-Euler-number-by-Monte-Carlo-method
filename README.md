# Estimation-of-Euler-number-by-Monte-Carlo-method
<p align="justify"> You are probably familiar with Euler's constant(e). This number is sometimes known as Napier's number, although each naming is done as a tribute to these mathematicians and the discoverer of this number is someone else. The first appearance of Napier's number in papers was in 1618 by John Napier, the inventor of the logarithm. Although he did not discover the constant itself, he did publish a list of logarithms that were obtained with the help of this constant. However, the list mentioned was probably prepared by William Oughtred. This constant was established 65 years later by Jacob Bernoulli in 1683 during the investigation of the limit of the following expression. </p>

<p align="justify"> In this project, we are going to estimate the value of this constant using the Monte Carlo method. Monte Carlo methods are a wide category of computational algorithms based on random sampling from the environment. In fact, in these methods, we try to use the randomness of samples to calculate a value that is inherently non-random. The first researches on this method started with the solution of Buffon's needle problem, and after that (almost since 1930), this method was used in simulations in the fields of biology, physics, engineering, etc. During the description of the problem, you will get to know this concept better. </p>

<p align="justify"> We are going to estimate the Euler constant. Consider the curve $f(x)=e^{−x}$. We turn our attention to the range of (0, 1): (the part inside the marked rectangle). </p>

### Part a.
<p align="justify"> Assuming Euler's constant, calculate the area of ​​the part of the rectangle cut off from the above figure that is under the exponential curve. (parametrically and according to e). </p>
